            Lesson 10: Atomic Structure
        </div>
        <div class="review">Atomic Structure is a fundamental concept in chemistry and physics. It deals with the composition and behaviour of atomic particles, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. The model of the atom has evolved over time, and one of the most significant contributions to its development was Dalton's Atomic Theory. <br><br>

            Dalton's Atomic Theory, proposed in the early 19th century, consists of five postulates. The first postulate is that all matter is made up of atoms, which are indivisible and indestructible. The second postulate states that all atoms of the same element have identical properties, such as mass and chemical behavior. The third postulate is that atoms of different elements have different properties. The fourth postulate is that atoms combine in whole-number ratios to form compounds. The fifth and final postulate is that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, but the atoms themselves remain unchanged. <br><br>
            
            Dalton's Atomic Theory was significant in the development of modern atomic theory and the periodic table of elements. It provided a framework for understanding the behavior of atoms and how they interact with each other. It also helped scientists identify and classify elements based on their atomic properties. <br> <br>
            
            Understanding Atomic Structure and Dalton's Atomic Theory is essential for students pursuing careers in science, engineering, and technology. It provides a foundation for understanding chemical reactions, materials science, and the behavior of matter at the atomic level. Mastery of this concept is crucial for students seeking careers in fields such as chemistry, physics, materials science, and nanotechnology. <br><br>
