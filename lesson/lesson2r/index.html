            States of Matter

            Gas, liquid, and solid matter are the three states of matter. <br><br><br>

            Gas - a state of matter that has no fixed shape and no fixed volume. The particles in a gas remain well apart and are not arranged uniformly. <br><br>
            
            Liquid - a state of matter that can flow and have definite volume and does not have a specific shape like a solid. Particles of liquid are close together but not in an ordered manner. <br><br>
            
            Solid -a state of matter that has definite shape and definite volume. It is a substance whose molecules cannot move freely and its particles are tightly arranged and closely compressed. <br><br>
            
            Energy, light, and sound are not classified as matter, because they do not occupy space, have no mass or volume. <br><br>
            
            Van der Waals model - A liquid-to-vapour phase transition can be shown in the van der Waals model of a fluid<br><br><br><br>
           <strong> Solid Definition</strong> <br><br><br>
In solids, particles are tightly or closely packed. <br><br>
The gaps between the particles are tiny and hence it is tough to compress them. <br><br>
Solid has a fixed shape and volume. <br><br>
Due to its rigid nature, particles in solid can only vibrate about their mean position and cannot move. <br><br>
Force of attraction between particles is adamant.<br><br>
The rate of diffusion in solids is very low.<br><br>
An example of solids: solid ice, sugar, rock, wood, etc.<br><br><br><br>
<strong>Liquid Definition</strong> <br><br><br>
In a liquid state of matter, particles are less tightly packed as compared to solids. <br><br>
Liquids take the shape of the container in which they are kept. <br><br>
Liquids are difficult to compress as particles have less space between them to move. <br><br>
Liquids have fixed volume but no fixed shape. <br><br>
The rate of diffusion in liquids is higher than that of solids. <br><br>
Force of attraction between the particles is weaker than solids. <br><br>
Example of a liquid state of matter: water, milk, blood, coffee, etc. <br><br><br><br>
<strong>Gas Definition</strong> <br><br><br>
In gases, particles are far apart from each other. <br><br>
Force of attraction between the particles is negligible, and they can move freely. <br><br>
Gases have neither a fixed volume nor a fixed shape. <br><br>
The gaseous state has the highest compressibility as compared to solids and liquids. <br><br>
The rate is diffusion is higher than solids and liquids. <br><br>
The kinetic energy of particles is higher than in solids and liquids. <br><br>
An example of gases: air, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. <br><br>
