        <div class="review">Understanding functional groups is essential in organic chemistry as they play a significant role in a compound's unique chemical reactions and properties. Let's review the key points: <br><br><br>

            Definition of Functional Groups: <br><br><br>
            
            Functional groups are specific groups of atoms or bonds within a substance that are responsible for the compound's characteristic chemical reactions. Different functional groups exhibit similar reactivity patterns regardless of the compound they are found in. In organic compound naming, functional groups are crucial for distinguishing compounds by combining the functional group names with parent alkane names. <br><br><br><br>
            
            Covalent Bonds and Connectivity: <br><br><br>
            Covalent bonds connect the atoms within a functional group and link the functional group to the rest of the molecule. The first carbon atom that attaches to the functional group is called the alpha carbon, followed by the beta carbon, gamma carbon, and so on. <br><br><br><br>
            
            Classification of Alcohols: <br><br><br>
            Alcohols (-OH) are a common functional group. They can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the number of carbon atoms bonded to the central carbon of the alcohol group. <br><br><br>
            
            Functional Groups and Reactivity: <br><br><br>
            Functionalization refers to the process of adding functional groups to a molecule through chemical synthesis. This technique is used in materials science to modify surface qualities and in chemical device applications to covalently bind functional molecules. Functional groups significantly influence and direct chemical processes, and specific groups can enhance reactivity and specificity in reactions. <br><br><br><br>
            
            Common Functional Groups: <br><br><br>
            In organic chemistry, common functional groups include carbonyls (C=O), alcohols (-OH), carboxylic acids (CO2H), esters (CO2R), and amines (NH2). Recognizing functional groups is important as they dictate the physical and chemical properties of compounds. <br><br><br>
            
            Understanding functional groups allows chemists to predict and manipulate chemical reactions, guide synthesis procedures, and comprehend the behavior of organic compounds. By identifying and understanding the properties of functional groups, researchers can design and tailor compounds with desired characteristics for various applications. <br><br><br></div>
