        <div class="review">Polymers are versatile molecules composed of repeating units. They can form three-dimensional, two-dimensional, or one-dimensional networks. Examples of natural polymers include DNA, RNA, proteins found in spider silk, hair, and horn, as well as starch and cellulose. Synthetic polymers, such as rubber and plastics, are manufactured using raw materials like rubber tree latex and cellulose. Bakelite, developed in 1909, was the first synthetic plastic, while rayon, made from cellulose, was the first polymeric fiber in 1910. Nylon, created in 1935, was developed while working on synthetic spider silk. <br><br><br>

            Most polymers consist of long chains of carbon atoms, known as the backbone, bonded together with hydrogen. Some polymers contain only carbon and hydrogen, like polyethylene and polystyrene, while others have additional elements. For example, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) contains chlorine, and Teflon contains fluorine. Nylons have nitrogen atoms in their backbone, while polyesters and polycarbonates have oxygen. There are also inorganic polymers with silicon or phosphorous backbones. <br><br><br>
            
            Manufactured polymers can be classified as thermoplastic or thermoset. Thermoplastic polymers can be heated and reformed multiple times, allowing for easy processing and recycling. Thermoset polymers, on the other hand, cannot be remelted once they are formed and reheating them causes degradation without melting. <br><br><br>
            
            In summary, polymers are useful molecules with diverse structures found abundantly in nature and produced synthetically. They can be composed of hydrocarbons or contain other elements in their backbones. Understanding the characteristics of polymers, such as being thermoplastic or thermoset, is essential for their processing and applications.<br><br><br></div>
